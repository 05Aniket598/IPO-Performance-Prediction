## 🧠 Project Objective

Retail investors often invest in IPOs based on media hype or peer advice, without enough financial analysis — which can lead to losses, especially when IPOs are overvalued or part of manipulated market activity.

This project aims to predict whether investing in a **recently launched IPO** is a **"Good to Go", "Wait", or "Avoid"** decision — based on:

* Subscription patterns (QIB, HNI, Retail)
* Financial health of the company
* Promoter holding
* Business tenure since listing

## 🏗️ Project Structure

### 📥 Phase 1: Data Collection ✅

Collected and stored data from **2019 to 2025**, including:

* 📊 **Mainboard & SME IPOs**  
* 📈 **Financial Statements** (Annual Results, Balance Sheet, Cash Flow)  
* 📉 **Financial Ratios**
* 📦 **Secondary Data** (like subscription and listing gains)

✔️ All data is saved in `.csv` format for easier analysis.

### 🧹 Phase 2: Data Cleaning

* Standardizing formats
* Handling missing values
* Creating meaningful features (e.g., market tenure)

### 📊 Phase 3: EDA

* Visualize IPO activity trends and sector distribution
* Analyze relationship between subscription and listing gain
* Correlation heatmaps and feature inspection

### 🤖 Phase 4: Modeling & Prediction

* Feature engineering (Subscription, Financials, Holding)
* Model selection: Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.
* Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Precision, AUC-ROC

### 📊 Phase 5: Dashboard (Power BI or Streamlit)

* Interactive filter to check IPO performance prediction
* Filter by: Year, Industry, Subscription Type, Label, etc.
